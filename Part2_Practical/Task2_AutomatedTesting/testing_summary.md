AI-powered automated testing improves accuracy and coverage compared to manual testing. In this task, the Selenium IDE test validates both valid and invalid login attempts. AI plugins enhance this process by automatically identifying UI elements, updating selectors when the interface changes, and suggesting additional test cases based on patterns in user interactions. This reduces the number of flaky tests, which are common in manual scripting.

Manual testing relies heavily on human effort and misses many edge cases. AI extends coverage beyond what a human tester can write manually and can detect issues such as slow-loading elements or unexpected UI changes. It also improves maintainability because AI-generated selectors adapt when the DOM changes. Overall, AI significantly reduces the time required to build and maintain tests while increasing reliability and scalability.
