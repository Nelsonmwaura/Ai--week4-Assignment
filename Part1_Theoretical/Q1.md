Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?
Suggested Answer

AI code generation tools reduce development time by:

Auto-completing code, reducing typing effort.

Suggesting entire functions based on comments or partial code.

Learning from patterns, so they provide context-aware suggestions.

Reducing time spent searching documentation by providing inline examples.

Limitations:

They sometimes generate incorrect or insecure code.

They may not understand full project context → suggestions might not fit.

They can reinforce outdated or biased training data.

Developers may become overly reliant on them.
