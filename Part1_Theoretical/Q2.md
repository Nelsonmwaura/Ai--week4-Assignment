Q2: Compare supervised vs unsupervised learning in automated bug detection.
Suggested Answer

In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled examples:
→ e.g., code snippets labeled as bug or no bug.
This works well when you have a dataset of known bugs and can detect similar issues in new code.

In unsupervised learning, the model finds hidden patterns without labels:
→ useful for detecting anomalies, such as unusual code patterns that might hint at unknown bugs.
Unsupervised methods are helpful when labeled bug data is scarce.
